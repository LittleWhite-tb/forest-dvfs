ArchTester - Small utility to know if you current arch is a sandy bridge

The tool is heavely based on work done by Todd Allen in its CPUID tool.


Compilation :

    make

Usage :

    ./archTester

The program can be used in a script, since it returns 0 when the CPU architecture is not a sandy bridge and 1 when it is
