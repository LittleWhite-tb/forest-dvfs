FoREST - Reactive DVFS Control for Multicore Processors

FoREST is a new DVFS running in background that will control the CPU frequency based on the CPU usage.

Hardware support:
- Intel x86: SandyBridge, IvyBridge
- Intel Xeon Phi (2013)

Dependencies :
- python (x86)
- msr-tools

Pre-Compilation:
This command is necessary to setup the submodules of the project.
git submodule update --init

The submodule projects are:
- lPowerProbe: http://code.google.com/p/lpowerprobe/
- PythonForMIC: https://github.com/jphalimi/PythonForMIC

Compilation:
make [x86|mic]
make [x86-debug|mic-debug]
Note: On x86, make will ask for your password in order to run an offline script lasting several minutes in order to determine the impact of frequency transition on power consumption. Please do not run anything while running this phase.
Note: On Xeon Phi, make will ask for your password in order to transfer required data on the Xeon Phi card. Once transfered, you should follow the instructions.

Usage 
    ./FoREST [performance|energy]

Note: On Xeon Phi, please first connect to your card with ssh (typically: ssh mic0). Once there, please follow the instructions in the README file in the FoRESTOnMIC folder.
