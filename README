FoREST - Reactive DVFS Control for Multicore Processors

FoREST is a new DVFS running in background that will control the CPU frequency based on the CPU usage.

Notes :

    Currently the program only correctly supports SandyBridge. The Makefile will check you CPU architecture and avoid you to compile if you does not have a SandyBridge.

Dependencies :

    msr-tools

Compilation :

    make

Note that make will run the offline screen to determine the impact of frequency transition on power consumption. The script can take several minutes to run.

Usage :

    ./localRest powersave|energy
