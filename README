FoREST - Reactive DVFS Control for Multicore Processors

FoREST is a new DVFS running in background that will control the CPU frequency based on the CPU usage.

Hardware support:
- Intel x86: SandyBridge, IvyBridge
- Intel Xeon Phi (2013)

Pre-Compilation:
This command is necessary to setup the submodules of the project.
git submodule update --init

The submodule projects are:
- lPowerProbe: http://code.google.com/p/lpowerprobe/

Compilation:
make [x86|mic]
make [x86-debug|mic-debug]
Note: On x86, make will ask for your password in order to run an offline script lasting several minutes in order to determine the impact of frequency transition on power consumption. Please do not run anything while running this phase.
Note: On Xeon Phi, you will have to run the offline phase manually. Please read the README_MIC file for more details about the procedure.

Usage 
    ./FoREST [performance|energy]
